If you have any concerns, it's a good idea to discuss them with your pediatrician before starting sleep training."

Tummy time may also reduce the risk of your baby developing a flat head (positional plagiocephaly) and promotes overall physical development."
What are the consequences of insufficient tummy time?,"Insufficient tummy time can lead to delays in reaching motor skill milestones and affect the development of certain muscles. Babies who spend less time on their tummies may take longer to gain full control over lifting their chests and leaning on their hands, which is typically achieved around 6 months."
Are there any signs that indicate I should stop or modify tummy time for my baby?,"If your baby shows signs of discomfort, such as excessive fussiness, crying, or difficulty breathing, it's important to modify or stop tummy time.
